# :yum: Sep 2020 Update
I am working on a new version of Easy Syntax Tree. The new version will support important features like drawing movement, and undo/redo. The new versions uses React, TypeScript, and all the best techonlogies available. I'll post an update here as soon as I complete new Easy Syntax Tree.

# Easy Syntax Tree
Easy Syntax Tree is an web tool to create linguistic syntax tree easily, interactively.
(What You See Is What You Get.)

Try it [here](https://jiahao-c.github.io/EasySyntaxTree/) **This project is still in development.** Important features like drawing movements is yet to be implemented.

**Pull requests are more than welcomed.**

## Motivation
When I took Intro to Linguistics (LING 201) in McGill, I found drawing syntax tree with a bunch of labelled bracket notation (for example, `[S[NP[N Alice]][VP[V is][NP[N'[N a student][PP^ of physics]]]`) is exhausting, and it gets even worse when modifying the tree, relocating a subtree, adding triangles, or drawing movements. I dreamed of a tool that can simplify the creation of a syntax tree.

While there are a few GUI programs such as [TreeForm](http://www.mapsofspeech.com/2017/10/02/treeform/) [Linguistic Tree Constructor](http://ltc.sourceforge.net/), they require specific platforms (Windows) and dependencies (.NET, Java...). Obviously, opening a web page would be much easier than a installing a desktop software. 

## Features
- Interactive
- Serverless (Static Webpage)
- Fully client-side drawing (Works Offline Once Loaded)
- Vertor graphics, crystal-clear image
- Easy export to SVG and PNG
